# Introduction
Robots would be pretty useless without having the ability to do stuff on their own. Today, with ever more powerful machine learning techniques, robots are on their way to becoming truly autonomous. 
Different aspects of Automation include Planning, Controls and State estimation.

From the moment we wake up in the morning until our head hits the pillow at night, we must plan our actions. A large problem in the development of autonomous robots is devising a way to give them the capabilities to make their own plans in a variety of situations.  Motion planning refers to the computational process of moving from one place to another in the presence of obstacles.

The robot control system directs the motion and sensory processing of a robot.We need the controllers because the dynamics (system plant) vary with the time. Such as when the robot moves up in a slope and then down in the slope, or first travels on smooth concrete, then on a carpeted floor.

A key aspect of robotics today is estimating the state, such as position and orientation, of a robot as it moves through the world. Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders or a combination of these to localise themselves in a three-dimensional world.
