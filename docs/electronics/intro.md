# Introduction
From interfacing microprocessors to making logical circuits, Robotics is incomplete without electronics. Every task that a Robot performs at the end eventually boils down to some signal received by it. 
Electronics for any robotics projects involves tasks like setting up the power source, interfacing sensors, setting up the computation unit, etc. 

Most of the Robots have a processing unit on them which collects data from sensors and peforms all the calculations for determining the steps that the robot needs to peform. Some of the popular processing units used for robots are Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson, Arduino, etc.

Sensors are the medium through which any robot interacts with its environment. Some of the common sensor we can see in robots are depth cameras, LIDAR, Encoders, IMU, etc.
