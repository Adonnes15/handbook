# Introduction
Mechanical aspects of robotics involve desiging,building and testing mechanical sensors and devices for a robot. 

This includes the robot configuration, type of robot, joint mechanisms, axes, heat transfer characteristics, mounting positions, among many other aspects that go into the creation of a new robot. 
CAD or other design software is used to create a new robot concept and how to best manufacture it. 

Mechanical design also involves solving the kinematics and dynamics equation of the robot, which are essential for peforming any task with robots.
